Welcome to Simple Earth Scale Install (SESI)

This is a collection of mods designed to allow you to play a more realistic game of KSP on the real solar system.  
I (mikebell) put this together after following the instructions in the Realism Overhaul thread: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59207
It seemed that getting all those mods, and working out a set of options that play well together took a bit of time, so I thought I'd share the results so others could try realistic KSP more easily.

The package ishosted on github:
