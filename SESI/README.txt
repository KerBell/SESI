Welcome to Simple Earth Scale Install (SESI)

This is a collection of mods designed to allow you to play a more realistic game of KSP on the real solar system.  
I (mikebell) put this together after following the instructions in the Realism Overhaul thread: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59207
It seemed that getting all those mods, and working out a set of options that play well together took a bit of time, so I thought I'd share the results so others could try realistic KSP more easily.

A zip of the latest version is available at: http://kerbell.rddev.co.uk/SESI-latest.zip

The package is version controlled on github: https://github.com/KerBell/SESI

Currently SESI works with KSP v0.23.5.

== Known problems ==

- Tech limits on procedural tank size are not applied after the part is saved and reloaded
- Procedural solid boosters of the same type are all capped to the same thrust.  To workaround this I've added a second procedural vacuum SRB, with identical characteristics.  This allows two different vacuum SRB configurations if desired.
- Sometimes the Decurion fails to start when in flight, though I'm not sure if that's a bug or a feature.

== Play hints ==

- You need much more delta-V to get off Earth compared to Kerbin.  You'll need a big, multi-stage rocket.
- The real fuel engines take Liquid oxygen and Kerosene separately, you'll need to calculate the tank sizes from the proportions listed on the engine to build an optimal rocket.
- Most of the engines in the early stages of the tech tree will only start once, so think carefully about how you get stuff back out of orbit.
